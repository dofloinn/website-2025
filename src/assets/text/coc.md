# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

SISTEM is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There is no need to be mean or rude.

Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. Private harassment is also unacceptable. In particular, we do not tolerate behaviour that excludes people in socially marginalised groups. We interpret the term “harassment” as including but not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Invasion of personal space
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

Event organisers may take action to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.

Our enforcement policies apply to all official SISTEM venues; including Discord, Github repositories, Social Media platforms (included but not limited to Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram and LinkedIn) and all forums under sistemconf.com.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts at our in-person events and with Organiser titles at online events. Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone.

You can make a report personally by contacting the conference or an individual organiser and all reports whether personal or anonymously will be investigated. Our aim is to act as quickly and responsibly as possible to prevent recurrence. Our organisers will ensure that you are in a safe space to make any report, they may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. We will handle all reports with confidentiality, respect and compassion. You may involve another person for support and will not be expected to engage in confrontation.
